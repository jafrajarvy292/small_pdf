This is just a repo containing a very small PDF document. It's intended to be used in scenarios where you need to transfer a sample PDF document via Base64 and don't want the encoded string to clutter your screen.

It seems to open fine in all the popular PDF viewers I've tested; however, some will ask you if you want to save changes upon close (i.e. Adobe) in an attempt to fix it to adhere to PDF standards.
